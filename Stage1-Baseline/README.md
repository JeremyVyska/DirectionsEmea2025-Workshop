# Stage 1: Your First AI Coding Session

Welcome! You're about to experience coding with AI assistance for the first time (or see it in a new way).

## What You'll Do (22 minutes)

- **Demo** (8 min): Watch the instructor code with AI
- **Your Turn** (11 min): Add a feature using AI
- **Reflect** (3 min): What just happened?

## The Goal: Experience AI Coding

Forget everything complicated. Here you'll just:
1. Open a file
2. Ask AI to add something
3. See it work

That's it. No theory, no best practices yet. Just experience the **vibe** of coding with AI.

## Demo: Watch First

The instructor will show you how to:
- Open an AL file
- Ask AI to add a simple feature (like a discount field)
- Accept the suggestions
- See it compile

**Key observation**: AI writes code fast. Really fast.

## Your Turn: Add a Feature

Now you try! Pick ONE of these simple additions:

### Option 1: Add "Customer Email" to Bookings
```
Add a "Customer Email" field to the Booking table so we can contact customers
```

**Files to modify:**
- `BookingCore/src/Booking.Table.al`
- `RentalOperations/src/BookingCard.Page.al`

### Option 2: Add "Equipment Status"
```
Add a status field to Equipment table to track if equipment is Available, In Use, or Under Maintenance
```

**Files to modify:**
- `BookingCore/src/Equipment.Table.al`
- `RentalOperations/src/EquipmentCard.Page.al`

### Option 3: Add "Booking Notes"
```
Add a notes field to Booking table where staff can add internal comments about the rental
```

**Files to modify:**
- `BookingCore/src/Booking.Table.al`
- `RentalOperations/src/BookingCard.Page.al`

## How to Ask AI

Keep it simple:

```
Add a Customer Email field to this table, then add it to the page.
```

Then just accept what AI suggests!

## What You're Learning

Right now, you're learning:
- ✅ AI can write code for you
- ✅ It's fast
- ✅ It usually compiles
- ✅ You can get features working quickly

That's enough for Stage 1!

## What's Next?

**Stage 2**: We'll ask AI to *review* what we just built. Can it catch issues? What does it find?

**Stage 3**: We'll use BC-specific specialists to see what deep domain knowledge reveals.

But for now: **Just code with AI and see it work.** That's the vibe! ✨

## Tips for Success

- **Don't overthink it**: Just ask AI in plain English
- **Accept suggestions**: Don't edit manually yet
- **It's okay if it's imperfect**: We'll improve it in Stage 2
- **Have fun**: This should feel almost magical
