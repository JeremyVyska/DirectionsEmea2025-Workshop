# Stage 1 Exercise: Your First AI Feature

**Duration:** 11 minutes
**Goal:** Experience coding with AI - just make it work!

## Your Task

Pick ONE of these features and ask AI to add it:

### Option 1: Customer Email
Add a "Customer Email" field to bookings so you can contact customers.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a Customer Email field to the Booking table
```

**Files:**
- `BookingCore/src/Booking.Table.al`
- `RentalOperations/src/BookingCard.Page.al`

---

### Option 2: Equipment Status
Add a status field to track if equipment is Available, In Use, or Under Maintenance.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a status field to Equipment table: Available, In Use, or Under Maintenance
```

**Files:**
- `BookingCore/src/Equipment.Table.al`
- `RentalOperations/src/EquipmentCard.Page.al`

---

### Option 3: Booking Notes
Add an internal notes field for staff comments.

**Prompt:**
```
Add a notes field to Booking table for internal staff comments
```

**Files:**
- `BookingCore/src/Booking.Table.al`
- `RentalOperations/src/BookingCard.Page.al`

---

## How to Do It

1. **Open the file** in VS Code
2. **Open your AI assistant** (Copilot Chat, Claude Code, etc.)
3. **Type the prompt** from your chosen option
4. **Accept what AI suggests** - don't overthink it!
5. **Try to compile** (F5) - does it work?

## That's It!

Seriously, that's the whole exercise. Just:
- Ask AI
- Accept suggestions
- See if it works

**No need to be perfect.** We'll improve it in Stage 2.

## Quick Reflection (1 minute)

Before we regroup, think about:
- How fast was that?
- Did it compile?
- Does it feel complete?

Write down one thing you noticed:

```

## What's Next

**Stage 2**: We'll ask AI to review what we just built and see what it catches.

**Stage 3**: We'll use BC specialists to see what deep domain knowledge reveals.

But for now: You just coded with AI! That's the vibe! ✨
