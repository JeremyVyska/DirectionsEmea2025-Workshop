# Stage 1 Demo Script: Your First AI Feature

**Duration:** 8 minutes
**Goal:** Show participants how to code with AI - make it fun and approachable!

## Setup

- Start from clean main branch
- Have Booking.Table.al file ready
- AI assistant visible (Copilot Chat, Claude Code, etc.)
- Enthusiastic energy - this should feel magical!

## Demo Flow

### 1. The "Hello World" Moment (1 min)

**Say:**
> "Let's experience AI coding together. I'm going to add a simple feature - a discount field for bookings. Watch how fast this happens."

**Show the file:**
- Open `BookingCore/src/Booking.Table.al`
- Scroll through it briefly
- "Here's our Booking table. Let me ask AI to add a discount field."

### 2. Ask AI (1 min)

**Open AI assistant and type:**
```
Add a discount percentage field to the Booking table
```

**Say as AI works:**
> "Look at this... AI is writing the code right now. Adding the field, setting the type, adding it to the table structure..."

**Accept the suggestion** (inline or chat-based, depending on tool)

### 3. Show It Works (2 min)

**Say:**
> "That was what... 10 seconds? Let's see if it compiles."

**Press F5** (or show compile)

**If it compiles:**
> "It compiled! We just added a feature with AI in seconds. This is the 'vibe' of AI coding."

**If errors:**
> "Ah, small issue - let me ask AI to fix it." [Quick fix, keep moving]

### 4. The "Wait..." Moment (2 min)

**Say:**
> "Okay, that was fast. But let me ask you: What did we NOT think about?
>
> - Should this be a percentage or a fixed amount?
> - What if someone enters 150%?
> - Does this actually apply to the pricing calculation?
> - What about the UI - did it add to the page?
>
> AI gave us code that works. But working code isn't always production-ready code.
>
> That's okay! For now, we just wanted to experience AI writing code. Mission accomplished! ✨"

### 5. Transition to Exercise (2 min)

**Say:**
> "Now it's your turn! You're going to add a simple feature using AI. Pick one of three options:
>
> 1. Customer Email field
> 2. Equipment Status field
> 3. Booking Notes field
>
> Just ask AI, accept the suggestions, and see it work. Don't overthink it - we're just experiencing the vibe of AI coding.
>
> In Stage 2, we'll ask AI to *review* what we built and see what it catches.
>
> In Stage 3, we'll use BC specialists and see how domain knowledge changes everything.
>
> But for now: Have fun coding with AI! You have 11 minutes. Go!"

## Instructor Notes

### Energy & Tone
- **Enthusiastic**: This should feel exciting, not scary
- **Encouraging**: "Just try it!" not "Do it perfectly"
- **No judgment**: Working code is great for Stage 1

### Key Messages
- ✅ AI writes code fast
- ✅ It usually works
- ✅ This is just the beginning
- ⏸️ Save quality discussions for Stage 2

### Common Questions

**"What AI tool should I use?"**
> "Whatever you have! Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor - they all work. The patterns we're learning apply to all AI tools."

**"My AI did something different than yours"**
> "Perfect! That's actually a great observation. AI can solve problems different ways. We'll discuss this more in Stage 2."

**"Should I fix the issues I see?"**
> "Not yet! Stage 2 is about review. For now, just experience AI writing code."

### Timing Check
- If ahead: Let participants start early
- If behind: Skip the "Wait..." moment, go straight to exercise
- Keep energy high throughout!
