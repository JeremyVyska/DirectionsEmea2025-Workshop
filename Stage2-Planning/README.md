# Stage 2: Testing AI Code Review

Welcome to Stage 2! Now we'll test whether AI can help us catch the issues we saw in Stage 1.

## What You'll Experience (28 minutes)

- **Demo** (10 min): Watch the instructor ask AI to review code
- **Your Turn** (15 min): Test AI review on different files
- **Discussion** (3 min): What did AI catch? What did it miss?

## The Question

Stage 1 showed code written under time pressure. Now we ask:

**"Can AI help us find these issues through code review?"**

## Your Task: Test AI Code Review

You'll ask your AI assistant (GitHub Copilot, Claude, etc.) to review files and track what it finds.

### Files to Review

Pick 2-3 of these files to review:

1. **BookingMgt.Codeunit.al** - Booking management logic
2. **Booking.Table.al** - Core data structure
3. **BookingCard.Page.al** - User interface
4. **AvailabilityMgt.Codeunit.al** - Availability checking

### Prompts to Try

Start simple:
```
Review this file for issues and suggest improvements
```

Get specific:
```
Review this file for performance issues
```

```
Review this file for code quality issues
```

### Track Your Findings

As AI reviews each file, note:
- ✅ What issues did it catch?
- ❌ What did it miss (that you noticed in Stage 1)?
- 💡 Did it suggest anything surprising?

**Tip**: Don't just accept the first response. Ask follow-up questions!

## What to Expect

AI is helpful but has limitations. You might see it catch:
- Style issues (formatting, naming)
- Obvious problems (hardcoded values, missing validation)
- General best practices

But it might miss:
- Platform-specific patterns
- Performance implications
- Deep architectural concerns

## Why Does This Matter?

Understanding what AI can and can't do helps you:
- Know when to trust AI suggestions
- Know when to dig deeper yourself
- Set realistic expectations for AI tools

## What's Next?

**Stage 3**: We'll introduce BC-specific AI specialists who have deep domain knowledge. You'll see how specialized knowledge dramatically improves AI's ability to find issues.

## Tips

- **Be thorough**: Try multiple prompts on each file
- **Be skeptical**: Question AI's suggestions
- **Compare notes**: Discuss findings with others
