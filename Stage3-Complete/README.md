# Stage 3: AI with BC-Specific Knowledge

Welcome to Stage 3! You've seen AI's limitations in Stage 2. Now experience what happens when AI has deep Business Central knowledge.

## What You'll Experience (40 minutes)

- **Demo** (20 min): Watch BC specialists review the code
- **Your Turn** (17 min): Ask specialists to review files
- **Discussion** (3 min): How much better was this?

## Meet the BC Specialists

If you installed **BC Code Intelligence MCP**, you now have access to specialists:

- 🔧 **Dean Debug**: Performance expert
- ✅ **Roger Reviewer**: Code quality & security
- 🎨 **Uma UX**: User experience expert
- 🔌 **Jordan Bridge**: Integration expert

Each specialist has deep BC knowledge that generic AI doesn't have.

## How to Use Specialists

### If You Have MCP Installed

Simply address the specialist by name:

```
Dean, review this file for performance issues
```

```
Roger, check this file for code quality problems
```

```
Uma, review the user experience
```

```
Jordan, analyze integration and extensibility
```

The specialist automatically retrieves BC best practices and applies them.

### If You Don't Have MCP

No problem! Reference the `.al-guidelines` folder:

```
Review knowledge files in .al-guidelines/domains/dean-debug/ then analyze this file for performance issues
```

Both approaches work - this way just relies on the agent to understand how to apply the knowledge.

## Your Task: Test BC Specialists

Compare specialist reviews to what you found in Stage 2.

### Step 1: Pick a Specialist

Start with one specialist that interests you:
- **Dean** if you care about performance
- **Roger** if you care about code quality
- **Uma** if you care about user experience
- **Jordan** if you care about extensibility

Or ask `Who is on the bc team?` to get a list!

### Step 2: Ask for a Review

Use their name and be specific:

```
Dean, review this app for performance issues and provide detailed recommendations
```

### Step 3: Compare Results

How does this compare to Stage 2 generic AI?
- Did the specialist catch more issues?
- Are the recommendations more specific?
- Do they reference BC-specific patterns?

### Step 4: Try Other Specialists (time permitting)

Each specialist covers a different quality dimension. Try 2-3 specialists to see comprehensive coverage.

## What Makes Specialists Different?

**Generic AI** (Stage 2):
- General programming knowledge
- Common patterns
- No platform expertise

**BC Specialists** (Stage 3):
- Deep BC platform knowledge
- Specific BC patterns (SIFT keys, permission sets, etc.)
- Production-ready recommendations

## The Big Picture

Software development isn't just coding. It includes:
- Performance
- Security
- User experience
- Extensibility
- Error handling
- Telemetry
- Documentation

**Developers are strongest at coding.** Time pressure means we often skip these other dimensions.

**BC Specialists cover all dimensions** - catching issues you don't have time to find manually.

This is **augmentation**, not replacement. AI helps you be production-ready faster.

## What's Next?

Take this workflow back to your work:
1. Write code (you're great at this)
2. Ask specialists to review (they catch what you miss)
3. Ship higher-quality code faster

## Advanced Challenge (Optional)

Ask a specialist to create a comprehensive report:

```
Dean, review this entire app and create a detailed markdown file with all your performance recommendations
```

See how thorough specialist analysis can be.
