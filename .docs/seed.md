Title: "Getting Started with Vibe Coding in Business Central" (The AI-generated title works perfectly - it's accessible but specific enough to set clear expectations)

Session Owner: Jeremy Vyska (me) as primary presenter – this is a journey for people to undertake, and I’m strong at storytelling and giving real context / application.

Enhanced Abstract: 
Ready to code at the speed of thought? In this 105-minute hands-on workshop, you'll explore Vibe coding with Microsoft Dynamics 365 Business Central and discover how to progressively build your AI collaboration skills from basic prompting to advanced agentic workflows.

We'll start with a reality check: what can AI do with no guidance? Then we'll work through a practical progression that changes how you collaborate with AI. You'll learn to use AI as a planning partner before jumping into code, master the art of crafting and refining instructions that get better results, and explore role-based AI personas that match your expertise level.

Through guided hands-on exercises using a familiar Contoso-style BC project, you'll build real extensions while learning sustainable AI adoption patterns. We'll cover environment setup, AL code generation techniques, and most importantly - how to train your AI to get better at helping you over time.

What you'll learn:
•	How AI collaboration evolves from basic prompting to strategic partnership
•	Practical techniques for using AI to plan your development work
•	The art of crafting and iteratively improving AI instructions
•	Role-based AI approaches for different experience levels
•	Real-world integration of AI tools into your BC development workflow

Format: Highly interactive workshop with a GitHub template project that participants can clone and continue learning with after the session.

Workshop Progression: 
We'll move through four distinct stages of AI adoption that mirror how most developers naturally progress with these tools.
•	Stage 1 shows what happens when you use AI with minimal guidance - establishing a baseline.
•	Stage 2 introduces AI as a planning partner, where you collaborate on approach before writing code, and learn to refine your instructions based on what works.
•	Stage 3 explores role-based AI personas - a "Diagnostics" mode for experienced developers who want deeper code analysis, and a "Rookie Onboarding" mode for those newer to BC development.
•	Stage 4 demonstrates knowledge-rich AI interactions using community Best Practices repositories, showing how shared context and specialized instructions create more powerful development partnerships.

This approach focuses on building sustainable AI adoption skills rather than just showing off what AI can do - I think that's what will really help attendees long-term.  They can also use the teaching repo to bring that knowledge “back home” to help their peers take the same journey.
